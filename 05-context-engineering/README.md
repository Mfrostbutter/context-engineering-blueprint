# 05 — Context Engineering

This is the core skill. Everything else in this repo supports it.

**Prompt engineering** is the art of asking AI good questions.
**Context engineering** is the art of structuring your work so the AI always has the right information — without you having to ask.

The difference: prompt engineering requires effort every session. Context engineering is a one-time investment that compounds.

## The problem with web chat AI

When you use Claude.ai or ChatGPT without any setup:
- The AI knows nothing about your project
- You re-explain context every conversation
- Nothing is remembered between sessions
- The AI makes decisions without knowing your rules, preferences, or constraints

This is like hiring a contractor who shows up to every job with no memory of previous visits.

## The context engineering solution

A well-structured project with a CLAUDE.md file means:
- Claude Code reads your project context before every session
- Your rules are enforced automatically
- The AI knows your folder structure, naming conventions, and constraints
- You spend time on work, not re-explaining

This is like having a contractor who reads the job file before every visit.

## The big ideas

### 1. CLAUDE.md is a control plane, not prose
Don't write paragraphs. Write structured metadata. The AI reads this like a database, not a letter.

### 2. Load-on-demand references
CLAUDE.md should point to detailed docs, not contain them. "Deployment guide: `docs/deploy.md`" is better than pasting the whole guide in.

### 3. Your folder structure communicates intent
`prototypes/` means "experimental, not production." `docs/` means "reference material." The names matter — the AI uses them to understand what kind of work belongs where.

### 4. The knowledge folder is your extended knowledge base
A `knowledge/` folder full of markdown files is context that persists. When you capture a decision in `knowledge/decisions/`, it's there the next time the AI needs it — without you having to remember to mention it.

## What to do next

Read [what-is-claude-md.md](./what-is-claude-md.md) first, then work through the others in order.
